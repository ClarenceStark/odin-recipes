    <h4><em>Beef and Guinness Stew</em></h4>
    <p>
      This Guinness beef stew is a very simple dish, but at the same time, it
      has a deep, complex, rich flavor. The maltiness of dark beer really does
      amazing things for the gravy. I served this in a nice ring of green
      onion-mashed potatoes. I hope you give this a try, whether for Saint
      Patrick's Day or any time of the year.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Bacon:</strong> This Guinness stew starts with bacon. You'll use
        the bacon and the bacon fat to cook the beef.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Beef:</strong> Cut your boneless beef chuck into 2-inch pieces.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Seasonings and herbs:</strong> This flavorful beef stew is
        seasoned with salt, black pepper, fresh garlic, white sugar, and fresh
        thyme.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Beer:</strong> Of course, you'll need a can of dark beer (such
        as Guinness).

        <strong>Vegetables:</strong> This chunky Guinness stew features onions,
        carrots, and celery.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tomato paste:</strong> Tomato paste adds richness and flavor
        depth.
      </li>
      <li>

        chicken or beef stock.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Mashed potatoes:</strong> Mashed potatoes are optional, but they
        make a great bed for the Guinness stew. Try our top-rated Basic Mashed
